# Kirk_Patrick_Seidel_Convex_Hull_API
This is an implemetation and visualization of Kirk Patrick Seidel Convex Hull Algorithm for 2D points.

To run this, you can just open the terminal and run the following command:
  ./script.sh
  
Or if you want to modify the source-code or input:
  1. Open the testing.cpp file
  2. You can modify the input by giving the input into input.txt file
  3. You can use different functions available in this API(check doxygen documentation provided by going into "html/index.html") to modify the code.
  4. Then do the following commands
        g++ testing.cpp
        ./a.out
        python3 new_visual.py
  5. You can check the resulting output visualization as kirk.gif in the same directory.
